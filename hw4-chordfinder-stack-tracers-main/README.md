# ICS 372 – HW4: ChordFinder Web Application

## 🧭 Overview
This project builds on your HW3 ChordFinder by transforming it into a full Spring Boot web application. Users can enter 3–4 musical notes via a web interface and receive possible chord names based on dynamic chord definitions.

## 🔧 Features
- Web-based UI with note input form
- Support for Method 1 and Method 2 interval logic
- Dynamic loading of chord rules from JSON files
- 3–4 note input supported
- Spring Boot backend, Thymeleaf frontend
- Optional REST API (Extra Credit)
- Extended test coverage with JUnit 5

## 📁 Project Structure
- `src/main/java/groupx/hw4/chordfinder` – Main app code
- `src/test/java/groupx/hw4/chordfinder` – Unit tests
- `src/main/resources/` – JSON chord rules and templates
- `src/main/resources/docs/` – Use Case, Domain, and Robustness models

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Import project into Eclipse as a Maven project
2. Run `ChordFinderApplication.java`
3. Open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser

## ✅ Responsible Use of Generative AI
You are encouraged to use tools like ChatGPT or Copilot as learning aids, but you must not use them to do the work for you. Submitting AI-generated work as your own violates the Academic Integrity Policy.

## 🧠 Assignment Goals
This assignment simulates real-world development by requiring you to extend a previous project, introducing challenges like:
- Maintaining and refactoring legacy code
- Understanding and managing technical debt
- Learning new frameworks (Spring Boot, Thymeleaf)
- Working with config-driven architectures
